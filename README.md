# RandomTopic
### This is a random topic page!!
## This could hopefully help you find a topic of your own!!!
# Step 1:
The first step is to calm down and take a deep breath. Then think about what you want to do for topics. For me, when I have to chose a certain topic, out of all the possibilities,  I would try to narrow it down to three or less. Pick your favorite topic out of the two or three and start writing! You could, for example, write about your favorite food, like sushi for example. Or a favorite book. 
# Step 2:
Gather your thoughts and try to organize them. That's what I like to do when choosing a topic. Maybe make a few notes on the way, or do some sort of research for an in-depth understanding of the topic.
# Step 3:
Just go for it and write it!!!
